=head2 '[' and '[<-' operators

The bracket operator currently only supports atomic get/set operations,
rather than allowing things like a[c(1,3)].

The get currently returns only ResizableFloatArray, because I haven't figured
out the switching to support both that and 
ResizableIntegerArray/ResizableFloatArray.

=head2 Indexing

Indexing currently starts at 0, not 1.

=head2 Default argument values

For example, dnorm(x) would assume mean=0 and sd=1...

=head2 Other issues

I know there are many other issues (some bugs, some just not completed
work, some simply not attempted work).  Feedback is welcome.
