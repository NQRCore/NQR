Creating the github repository.  At this point, the hack of
the squaak language still has some squaakish characteristics.

- Using Parrot 3.3.0 (will upgrade I hope soon)

- I haven't quite got the new 'for' action working (trying two
approaches).

- I have some basic class definitions, but haven't really done
anything and need to figure out inheritance (maybe Parrot 3.6.0
will help, arriving next week).

- I've done some things that may "look right" but aren't done
the "right way".  Advice is welcome, to help me learn.
