A little "todo" list for Jay in the next week or two:

- NCI example(s), at least generating random normals by using
the R libraries, and possibly something from the Parrot world,
like providing R-syntax regular expressions?

- Look into the mmap

- The possibility of a graphics kludge via d3 and javascript?

- Try to fix up the 'for' loop properly.

- Move up to 3.6.0 and try to get proper inheritance working.

Creating the github repository.  At this point, the hack of
the squaak language still has some squaakish characteristics.

- Using Parrot 3.3.0 (will upgrade I hope soon)

- I haven't quite got the new 'for' action working (trying two
approaches).

- I have some basic class definitions, but haven't really done
anything and need to figure out inheritance (maybe Parrot 3.6.0
will help, arriving next week).

- I've done some things that may "look right" but aren't done
the "right way".  Advice is welcome, to help me learn.
