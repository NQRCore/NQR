I'll try to keep this file VERY up-to-date with "gotcha's"
that I could use help on.  I've put these on the back burner
because I don't think I'll make much headway on them at the
moment.

1. In src/nqr/Actions.pm I'm having trouble with my for loop;
  see the Grammar.pm file for obvious definitions.  The
  attempt called 'myfor' is almost identical to what Whiteknight
  used in his matrixy project.  I just can't figure it out; the
  body of the loop isn't accessing the parameter.  If you are
  interested, I can provide a simple example.  There may be
  a recent hint attached to my blog entry (see below)

2. Even once this is solved, I think the loop behavior is not as
  desired.  I blogged about this, and it may not be the loop behavior,
  but an issue with handling of objects and assignments.

3. I expect some subtle grammar issues... print(sort(a)[0]) does
  not seem to work as desired, for example, and this is almost
  definitely a parser issue.  More testing is needed, and I may
  have made some changes to <primary>, etc... that are getting in
  the way, here.
