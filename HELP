I'll try to keep this file VERY up-to-date with "gotcha's"
that I could use help on.

1. In src/nqr/Actions.pm I'm having trouble with my for loop;
  see the Grammar.pm file for obvious definitions.  The
  attempt called 'myfor' is almost identical to what Whiteknight
  used in his matrixy project.  I just can't figure it out; the
  body of the loop isn't accessing the parameter.  If you are
  interested, I can provide a simple example.

2. Even once this is solved, I think the loop behavior is not as
desired.  I blogged about this, and it may not be the loop behavior,
but an issue with handling of objects and assignments.
