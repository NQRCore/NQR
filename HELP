I'll try to keep this file VERY up-to-date with "gotcha's"
that I could use help on.

1. https://gist.github.com/1081713

  The problem: I can create FixedFloatArray in pir, but can't
  figure out how to to it in NQP.  In contrast, I can do it
  for ResizableFloatArray in NQP, so I can't be far off.

2. In src/nqr/Actions.pm I'm having trouble with my for loop;
  see the Grammar.pm file for obvious definitions.  The
  attempt called 'myfor' is almost identical to what Whiteknight
  used in his matrixy project.  I just can't figure it out; the
  body of the loop isn't accessing the parameter.  If you are
  interested, I can provide a simple example.
