'Not Quite R' is language nqr, created from the
language 'Squaak' which was created with 
tools/dev/mk_language_shell.pl, r47087.

    $ parrot setup.pir
    $ parrot setup.pir test

This file contains various notes that I didn't want to lose but that
didn't deserve to be in STATUS.

# Changing grammar and actions:

1. Changed sub to function (forcing use of { } as discussed).
2. Re-implemented return.
3. Discovered some interesting scoping things, created t/nqr.t and
   testnqr.t
4. Modified conditionals to be closer to R syntax, requiring { }
5. Changed and, or, not to R usage &, |, !
6. expression used to be optable or something, now EXPR has no clear grammar?

# June 29, 2011

1. Colon operator (backed out these changes after lunch):
	- Two lines added to the grammar, with some re-lettering of
	  the operator (x, v, w, u?)
	- Added the builtins folder and ops.pir file
	- Modified setup.pir for this builtins/ops.pir.

2. Jay notes that squaak (at least) starts indexing at 0, not 1.

3. Jay played around in Runtime.pm as a possibly better way of doing things
than the old "builtins"?

4. Tried src/builtins/pirprint, with no luck.
	nqr.pir: .include 'src/builtins/pirprint.pir'
	setup.pir: src/builtins/pirprint.pir to the SOURCES

5. Oooo.... see Runtime.pm.

###############################################################################
# July 4, 2011

1. Jay noticed that stuff in src/nqr.pir would need changing along with
setup.pir and/or nqr.pir in the main directory if adding something like
the old builtins.

2. Added comments to Grammar.pm for future things to look at.

3. Deleted some older stuff from Grammar.pm.

4. Modified while loop syntax.

###############################################################################
# July 6, 2011

1. Fixed up some things and cleaned out comments.

2. Got rid of the annoying printing (3 hours of false starts)

3. False start: tried making everything a vector, no scalars.  Oops.
Might be possible, but not sure, seems to pose problems, you need to know
what is what once you get to the PIR level.

# Notes

I left some interesting action code at the bottom of Actions.pm but generally
tried to clean out junk to make things more readable.

--target=post	Shows the POST results, could be past, pasm, pir?

<?>		Always returns TRUE (a match) and useful for initialization actions;
		I think this is needed to initialize the scope stack.

$?BLOCK				Our current block
@?BLOCK				The stack of blocks
@?BLOCK.unshift($?BLOCK);	Put the current block onto the stack
my $past := @?BLOCK.shift();	Take the current block off the stack I think.

PAST::Block.new			Blocks for scoping
PAST::Stmts.new			Statements
PAST::Op.new			Operators (extensive)
PAST::Var.new			Variables: see lexical, isdecl, *register*
PAST::Val.new			Represent constant values

PAST nodes:
http://docs.parrot.org/parrot/devel/html/docs/pdds/pdd26_ast.pod.html

The action for parameters is VERY interesting for the scope discussion,
because it is here that the new block is created.



# JWE:
# Important: the usage of <block> in the do/end scope results in
# local variables that do not persist outside of the block.  In
# contrast, the use of <statement>* in the for loop results in
# the creation of global variables so to speak, persisting outside
# of the scope.  We do want this for loops.  Be careful with blocks,
# then, we want that sort of behavior for functions.

# Possibility: instead of their do/end, we might use { } with
# <statement>* instead of <block>?   Hmm... probably not, because of
# functions.

# JWE: Theorem: <?> creates a new environment or scope and then
# <statement>* is passed to a new parse tree?  If this is true, then
# blocks may or may not have side effects depending on the usage
# in the action file?

# JWE: note this use of dot, might relate in some way, above?
# See .begin_TOP and .begin_block I think.  Or maybe this is more like
# list member usage?


#### TODO 7/7/2011:   Remove var, etc...  consider scoping work and 'for'?

Parrot irc:

xchat	New Network: irc.parrot.org/6667, channel #parrot

Consider my own identifier: http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/NQP-rx%20Operator%20Precedence%20Parsing


jay: there's a lot of nqp-rx code out there. if you're looking for samples, rosella, partcl (https://github.com/partcl/partcl-nqp) both have a lot of it.

# Making a list:
http://www.parrotblog.org/2008/03/episode-5-variable-declaration-and.html

# For loop in NQP for runtimes I think:
#for @array -> $item { ... }

http://trac.parrot.org/parrot/wiki/

# Nice overview, some small details dated.
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Parrot_Virtual_Machine/Parrot_Compiler_Tools


# Adding a class:

github.com/Whiteknight/parrot-linear-algebra
github.com/Whiteknight/matrixy

# Probably a good PIR example.
https://github.com/Whiteknight/matrixy/blob/master/src/classes/matrix_row.pir

# Probably an important list.
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Parrot_Virtual_Machine/VTABLE_List

# Eventually useful, C markup for PMCs via macros, relevant for
# customized PMC in the HLL
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Parrot_Virtual_Machine/Built-In_PMCs

# List example?
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Parrot_Virtual_Machine/Classes_and_Objects

# See ManagedStruct and UnmanagedStruct.   FixedFloatArray PMC (FFA)

Might be issues with float != FLOATVAL?  double?  some option to Configure.pl?

jay: Rosella is to Parrot what BOOST is to C++. Adds a lot of building blocks. You probably don't need it yet, but I suspect you will want it for various purposes eventually

# Parrot memory-mapped files?
MappedByteArray: /home/jay/parrot-3.3.0/src/pmc/mappedbytearray.pmc

 We have a type for mmap
<plobsing> the system performance should be the same at the end of the day. I'm not an expert at kernel VM systems, but mmap and swap are handled fairly similarly.
<whiteknight> MappedByteArray
<jay> plobsing: could be, but in our tests there was quite a difference.  We also support Mac/WIndows/Linux and some Solaris, I think, via BOOST.  Not all swap behaves equally well.
<whiteknight> that doesn't do floats, but I'm sure it could be subclassed or tweaked
<jay> whiteknight: will I be able to grep it easily, or is there someplace I should look to find it's definition?
<whiteknight> jay: if you have the parrot source repo, it's src/pmc/mappedbytearray.pmc
<whiteknight> it's a simple type. Still young and marked "experimental". A real-world use case might help us to get it matured and improved
<jay> I'll glance at it now...


NQP and pir opcodes::::

jay: exactly. It's the new op. NQP will automatically try to coerce arguments to the correct types, so it can't intelligently pick which op to use from all the variants
<whiteknight> there are new__PS, new__PP, new__PPP, etc

# Some other testing:

a <- 1

foo <- function(a) {
    print("ok ", a)
    a <- 3
    b <- 2
}

foo(a)
print(a, b)

print("Interesting scoping decision above.")
print("Interesting issue if foo2 is changed to foo, below.")

foo <- function(a) {
    print("Inside function: ", a)
    #return(-1)
}

foo(5)

#return(0)

#b <- foo(7)
#print(foo(8))

#b <- return(3)
#print(b)
