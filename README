This is repository NQR in github organization NQRCore,
established June 30, 2011.  NQR stands for "Not Quite R".

If you aren't familiar with R, please see http://www.r-project.org.
It has a wonderful community and a mature, stable language for
statistical computing.  NQR is a sandbox for exploring the Parrot
Virtual Machine as a platform for a high-level language (HLL) using
the core R grammar.

To contribute, please drop us an email.  We particularly welcome
feedback and hints that help us learn more about Parrot.

= head2 Building from source

NQR requires Parrot (see http://www.parrot.org/).  If you can
build Parrot, you should be fine building NQR (which used
Parrot 3.3.0 as of July 8, 2011, and apparently still passes
tests on the almost-3.6.0 version).

There are additional requirements that are appearing: libRmath.so
from the R project, at the moment, and libgsl.so from the GNU
Scientific Library.  See comment in F<STATUS>.

To obtain NQR directly from its repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/NQRCore/NQR.git

Once you have a copy of NQR, build and test it as follows:

    $ parrot setup.pir
    $ parrot setup.pir test

To run interactively,

    $ ./installable_nqr

To run in batch mode (e.g. from a script):

    $ ./installable_nqr myscript.nqr
